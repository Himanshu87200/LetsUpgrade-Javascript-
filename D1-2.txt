Question 1 : Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.
var a=10;
let b=20;
const PI=3.14;

var: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is “function scoped”.
Example: var a =10;
Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.
Consider the following code.

function nodeSimplified(){

  var a =10;

  console.log(a);  // output 10

  if(true){

   var a=20;

   console.log(a); // output 20

  }

  console.log(a);  // output 20

}

let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
“let” and “const” are“block scoped”.
Example: let a =10;
The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.
Consider the following code.

function nodeSimplified(){

  let a =10;

  console.log(a);  // output 10

  if(true){

   let a=20;

   console.log(a); // output 20

  }

  console.log(a);  // output 10

}

const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
Example: const a =10;

function nodeSimplified(){

  const MY_VARIABLE =10;

  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10 

}
